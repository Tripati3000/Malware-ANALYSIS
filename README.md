# What is a Malware and Malaware analysis lab ?
 Malware is like a sneaky computer program that's designed to cause harm, like stealing information or damaging your computer.

A Malware Analysis Lab is a safe place where cybersecurity experts study these sneaky programs to understand how they work. It's like a detective's lab, where they examine the malware to figure out its tricks and how to stop it from causing trouble.

# Types of Malware Analysis 

1. **Static Analysis**: This is like looking at a suspect's photo and examining it closely without letting them move. In static analysis, experts study the malware's code and structure without actually running it. It helps in understanding what the malware does and how it does it, without risking harm to the computer.

2. **Dynamic Analysis**: This is like watching a suspect in action, observing their behavior and actions. In dynamic analysis, experts run the malware in a controlled environment (like a sandbox) and observe its behavior. They monitor what files it accesses, what network connections it makes, and what changes it makes to the system. This helps in understanding the malware's actions in real-time.

# What do we gonna do ?

1. **Setting up a VM (virtual machine) and install a windows 10 (ISO file) into VM**

2. **Installing Flare VM**

3. **Static analysis hands on practice**

4. **Dynamic analysis hands on practice**
